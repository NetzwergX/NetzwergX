I'm a student of computer science and a research assistant at the 
Chair V (Programming Systems) at TU Dortmund University.

The languages I work with are mainly Java and C# (.Net Core), as well a TypeScript.  
I'm versed in many of the supporting and underlying technologies for web development,
including, but not limited to:  
SQL (mainly MySQL), HTML, CSS, JS/TS and ORM (JPA & Hibernate, EF Core),
as well as DevOps and *Continuos Practices*.

I'm wrote my bachelor's thesis on **"Visual Authoring of CI/CD Pipeline
Configurations"** ([available here](https://archive.org/details/visual-authoring-of-cicd-pipeline-configurations/)) 
and developed a tool that allows the graphical composition of CI/CD 
pipelines (https://gitlab.com/scce/Rig), greatly reducing the complexity
of creating such pipelines and making CI/CD much easier accessible.
