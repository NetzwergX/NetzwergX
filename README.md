I'm a student of computer science at TU Dortmund University.

The languages I work with are mainly Java and C# (.Net Core), as well a TypeScript.  
I'm versed in many of the supporting and underlying technologies for web development,
including, but not limited to:  
SQL (mainly MySQL), HTML, CSS, JS/TS and ORM (JPA & Hibernate, EF Core),
as well as DevOps and *Continuos Practices*.

I'm wrote my bachelor's thesis on **"Visual Authoring of CI/CD Pipeline
Configurations"** and developed a tool that allows the graphical composition
of CI/CD pipelines (release of the tool is TBD), greatly reducing the complexity
of creating such pipelines and making CI/CD much easier accessible.
