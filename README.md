I'm a student of computer science at TU Dortmund while also working as freelancer, 
providing individual software solutions for my customers.

The languages I work with are mainly Java and C# (.Net Core), as well a TypeScript.  
I'm versed in many of the supporting and underlying technologies for web development,
inlcuding, but not limited to:   
SQL (mainly MySQL), HTML, CSS, JS/TS and ORM (JPA & Hibernate, EF Core).

I'm **currently writing my bachelors thesis** on a novel approach to *continuos practices*,
foremost in the context of *GitLab*, but also including the CI/CD pipeline of GitHub with 
GitHub Actions, with the goal of simplifying the configuration of pipelines and workflows
significantly and reducing the need to employ trial & error in order to arrive at a working
configuration.
