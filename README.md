I'm a student of computer science at TU Dortmund while also working as freelancer, 
providing individual software solutions for my customers.

The languages I work with are mainly Java and C# (.Net Core), as well a TypeScript.  
I'm versed in many of the supporting and underlying technologies for web development,
including, but not limited to:  
SQL (mainly MySQL), HTML, CSS, JS/TS and ORM (JPA & Hibernate, EF Core),
as welll as DevOps and *Continuos Practices*.

I'm **currently writing my bachelors thesis** on visual authoring of CI/CD pipeline
configurations and approaches to reduce complexity in such workflows, to reduce
errors and to improve clarity and documentation of such workflows.  
Currently, the focus is on *GitLab*.
